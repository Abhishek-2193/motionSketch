# motionSketch for Maya
A Maya tool written in Python to record manual object manipulation as animations and then generate path animations from the data with speed variability.

Enable recording mode in the tool window and manually move around objects to record as animations. You can then genberate a motion path from the recorded keyframes, smooth the motion path and also change speed of the animation.

To set up, download the script to your Maya scripts folder and create a new shelf tool that runs the code in 'toolCode.py'
